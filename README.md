# youtube-Sentiment-Analysis-with-emoji-
(bert deberta)
- This project explores how emoji sequences and their positions in text affect sentiment analysis of social media comments.
= We focus on YouTube comments that contain at least two consecutive emojis and investigate how emoji semantics and placement influence model performance.
= Our framework enhances traditional sentiment analysis models (BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa) by integrating emoji2vec embeddings and positional features, achieving better understanding of complex emotional expressions.

## Method
- Pretraining on ELCo
  - Masked Language Modeling on emojiâ€“text pairs
  - Learn semantic relationships between emoji sequences and phrases.
- Textual Entailment Pretraining
  - Construct premiseâ€“hypothesis pairs from real YouTube comments
  - Train the model to recognize whether an emoji combination matches the sentence emotion.
- Fine-tuning for Sentiment Classification
  - Use Kaggle YouTube Comments dataset
  - Add emoji2vec embeddings and emoji position as features.
